## Introduction 
 
### Dataset Description  
 
&gt; This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. It contains details about the movies, the directors, genres and the total budgets and revenues from the movies. 
 
 
 
### Question(s) for Analysis 
&gt; During this Analysis, We would address some question drawn from this question. The few questions that would be addressed a listed below: 
&gt; &lt;li&gt;What are the top 5 most popular movies released between 1960-2015?&lt;/li&gt; 
&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 21st Century, In which year was the most movies released?&lt;/li&gt; 
&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which directors produced the most movies in the 21st Century?&lt;/li&gt; 
&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what year was the most profit made?&lt;/li&gt;

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
 
&gt;In this section, we would carry out exploratory analysis to answer some of the questions that have been listed in the Introduction Section. We would see some trends and insights that are all gotten from our dataset. 
 
### What are the top 5 most popular movies released between 1960-2015? 
 
&gt;Since the popularity column is in a descending order, to get the top 5 most popular movies of all time, we simply check the top 5 rows of the dataset to print out the result

</span><span class="s1">### In what year was the most profit made? 
&gt; First, we start by creating a dataset to hold the sum of all the revenues and budgets in a year, using the budget_adj and revenue_adj column. Then, we get the profit made by subtracting the budget from the revenue made.

## Conclusions 
&gt; In the first question for analysis, Since the popularity column in the movie dataset happens to be sorted in descending order, we found out that the top 5 most popular movies from 1960 - 2015 according to their popularity rate where the first 5 columns of or dataset. This was then extracted and assigned to the popular_five dataframe. According to analysis done on this dataframe, Jurassic Park, which was released in 2015 topped the table with above 32.5 popularity rate, followed by Mad Max: Fury also released in 2015 with a popularity rate of 28.42. Other movies which appeared in the top 5 are Insurgent (2015), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Furious 7(2015). This movies had big superstars actors playing in them like, Vin Diesel, Harrison Ford, Chris Pratt, Tom Hardy amongst other names. 
&gt; 
&gt; Next, we found out which year in the 21st Century had the most movies. In doing this, we created a new dataframe that selected movies with their release years above 1999. From this dataframe, we were able to extract the value counts of each years in the dataframe. With 2014 having the most movies released in the 21st century with about 682 movies released in that year, 2015 came next with 642 movies released. We went ahead to draw a bar chart showing the Number of Movies released against the year they where released. 
&gt; 
&gt; We then moved on to get the top directors with the most movies directed in the 21st Century. This lead us to get the value count of each directors present in our dataset. Steven Soderbough and Tyler Perry directed the most movies with 2000-2015, with a total of 18 and 17 movies directed respectively. A few other directors also directed a number of movies, we have a chart showing the number of movies they directed and each directors. 
&gt; 
&gt; Profit made every year where gotten by creating a new dataframe that showed the total amount made over each years and the budget put into making movies over the year. We were able to get the profit by creating a new column in the dataframe, which contain the profit made. It was calculated by subtracting the budget put into the production of movies from the total revenue made in each year. The budget_adj and the revenue_adj columns where used. A chart showing the profit made against the year it was made was plotted. This showed that the highest profit was made in 2015 with about 17.6 trillion dollars made. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Movie Database showed great insights on each columns in it. With further analysis, more details can be gotten from the data given.
